|1.0	Overview
===================================================================================================
 1.1	General:
		this is a project witch target it is to simulate a PLC on base of an S7

		the whole project is in the main namespace CKT and then seperated into sub namespaces

		this project is divided into several projects:
		VM_CKTPLC			: the whole solution for a S7 virtual CPU
		[solution]

			CKTCommon		: this dll contains helper for the keyboard use and a commandline		[NS=CKT.INPUT]
			[dll]			  processor
							  this is a CKT standart libary

			CKTPLC_Basic	: this dll contains informations of the project witch will be needed	[NS=CKT.VM.PLC_Basic]
			[dll]			  by other projects of the VM_CKTPLC solution
			
			VM_CKTPLC		: this is the virtual maschine for the cpu to run						[NS=CKT.VM.CKTPLC]
			[exe]
				PLCManager	: this is the general manager of the PLC-CPU and starts/stopps the CPU
							  and manage the memorys for the instructions, stack, input, output, 
							  marker and controls the simple diagnostic function via a PLC-View
							  where you can give a file witch declares what you want to see
				
				PLCCPU		: this is the virtual CKT-PLC-CPU and do the intructions

			Compile_CKTPLC	: this is the compiler for all files for the CKT-PLC					[NS=CKT.VM.COMPILE]
			[exe]			  it compiles text files to object code files that can be read by 
							  the PLCManager
							  *.CED, *.CDB, *.CFB -> *.COB
							  *.CPR -> *.COP
							  *.CPV -> *.COV

			CKTPLC_Edit		: this is the Editor for all the files needed or used by the CKT-PLC	[NS=CKT.VM.EDIT]
			[exe]			  *.CED; *.CDB; *.CFB; *.CPR; *.CPV
			WPF Apllication	  the editor also has the funktion to watch the CKT-PLC States
							  and the Memory so it can be used for visualization of the CKT-PLC
							  and its actions
							  for this visu it will give a *.CEV file and a compiled version *.COV
							  this can be loaded in the editor to show the things you want
							  the editor can also load the PLC-COV files [*.CPV] and use this for 
							  visualization but the *.CEV file can do more things as show you in and 
							  outs or markers you can make a moveing modell of things and give them
							  outputs or inputs to move the objects [later if it is possible]
